yaml device config to tuya-local integration

It you want to help, you need:

- iot.tuya.com account
- tuya-cli and/or tinytuya
- minimal linux knowledge
- HA with HACS

tuya-cli (nodejs needed)
https://github.com/TuyaAPI/cli

tinytuya (python and pip needed)
https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya

# Important

the working configuration files will be deleted and committed to main tuya-local repo:

https://github.com/make-all/tuya-local

If you create a own config, please do not commit it here, do it the tuya-local main repository directly!
